# Water Footprint Visualizer

### Challenge Statement: How might we use technology to educate and connect people to the natural world?

### Scenario 1
Demonstrate how can we use technology to raise awareness and get more mainstream attention to green initiatives?

### Motivation
_"Water is essential for life. No living being on planet Earth can survive without it. It is a prerequisite for human health and well-being as well as for the preservation of the environment."_ - [United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.shtml)

The importance of water for sustaining the livelihood of humans, animals and plants alike is obvious, as is the fact that the amount of water we use now directly reduces the amount of water available for the future. What is _not_ so obvious is that the amount of water consumed by different countries varies greatly.

Being aware of differences in water usage across nations surfaces and challenges assumptions we may have about what is the "norm" regarding water use. For example, a certain amount of water can mean in a 30-minute shower in one country but a 2-day drinking water supply in another country!

#### Solution

The Water Footprint Visualizer web app [insert link here] allows us to compare the water footprint of domestic water consumption (quantified as average domestic water use per person per year in m<sup>3</sup>) of different countries.

The application also shows how simple changes an individual makes can result in water savings which could equate to a signficiant improvement in quality of life in other countries.


#### Data

The web app uses national water footprint statistics from [Water Footprint Network](https://waterfootprint.org/en/resources/waterstat/national-water-footprint-statistics/)...

## Scenario 4
2018 was the worst fire season on record as B.C. extends a state of emergency beating the record set only a year earlier in 2017. More than 13,000 square kilometres of the province had burned in 2018, and is estimated to double in damage in 2019.
Demonstrate how to use technology to educate the issues surrounding
- local forest fires,
- floods, and
- other **natural disasters.**
