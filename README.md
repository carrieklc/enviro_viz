# Water Footprint Visualizer

## Challenge Statement: How might we use technology to educate and connect people to the natural world?

### Scenario 1
Demonstrate how can we use technology to raise awareness and get more mainstream attention to green initiatives?

#### Motivation
_"Water is essential for life. No living being on planet Earth can survive without it. It is a prerequisite for human health and well-being as well as for the preservation of the environment."_ - [United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.shtml)

The importance of water for sustaining the livelihood of humans, animals and plants alike is obvious, as is the fact that the amount of water we use now directly reduces the amount of water available per person for the future as the global population continues to grow. What is _not_ so obvious is that the amount of water consumed by different countries varies greatly.

Being aware of differences in water usage across nations challenges assumptions we may have about what is the "norm" regarding water use. For example, a certain amount of water can mean a 30-minute shower in one country but a 2-day drinking water supply in another country!

#### Solution

The Water Footprint Visualizer web app [insert link here] allows us to compare the water footprint of domestic water consumption (quantified as average domestic water use per person per year in m<sup>3</sup>) of different countries.

The application also visualizes the effects of realistic changes an individual can make. The water savings could equate to a signficiant improvement in quality of life in other countries.


#### Data

Data used for this project comes from
- [Water Footprint Network](https://waterfootprint.org/en/resources/waterstat/national-water-footprint-statistbics/)
- [Per capita water use. Water questions and answers; USGS Water Science School](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/qa-home-percapita.html)
- [Drip calculator: How much water does a leaking faucet waste? USGS Water Science School](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/activity-drip.html)
- [How Much Water Does It Take To Wash Your Own Car At Home?](https://meguiarsonline.com/forums/showthread.php?61294-How-Much-Water-Does-It-Take-To-Wash-Your-Own-Car-At-Home)

### Scenario 4
2018 was the worst fire season on record as B.C. extends a state of emergency beating the record set only a year earlier in 2017. More than 13,000 square kilometres of the province had burned in 2018, and is estimated to double in damage in 2019.
Demonstrate how to use technology to educate the issues surrounding
- local forest fires,
- floods, and
- other **natural disasters.**

# Limitations and Future Enhancements
This application provides a quick overview of water use and a handful of reduction strategies.
The application can be expanded to explore the impact of other factors such as water use associated with agriculture (ex. meat consumption and the cultivation of agricultural goods such as avocados and almonds).
